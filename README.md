# Text To Speech Downloader
This is a slightly customized [Qt HTTP Example](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtnetwork-http-example.html "This example demonstrates how a simple HTTP client can fetch files from remote hosts.") to send written text to [google's text to speech API](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/basics).

*A google API key is needed.*

The result is a WAV file containing the text spoken by googles WaveNet voice. The file name also contains the spoken text for easy further processing.

We use this tool to produce voice overs for our videos at [EYEVIDO](https://eyevido.de "cloud eye tracking").
